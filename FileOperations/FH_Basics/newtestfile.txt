In 2000, U.S. toy retailer Toys "R" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon 
valued at $50 million per year plus a cut of sales
under which Toys "R" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service
and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys "R" Us sued Amazon
claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys "R" Us stock
Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys "R" Us had been granted exclusivity 
In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys "R" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its own independent e-commerce website
The company was later awarded $51 million in damages
