Deploying your static website on Amazon S3 is a cost-effective solution that is often cheaper than a traditional hosting provider.
I migrated my website to Amazon S3 years ago and have been saving money ever since!
This is a super fun project AWS newbies and introduces you to several core services like Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront.

You’ll create an Amazon S3 bucket to hold your static website files and an Amazon CloudFront distribution to serve your website globally.
 Amazon Route 53 will manage your domain name, and AWS Certificate Manager will provide a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
